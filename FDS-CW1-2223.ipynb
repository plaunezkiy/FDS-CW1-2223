    "\n",
    "Submission deadline: **Friday, 4 November, 12:00 UK time**\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Late submission rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This coursework uses the  [Informatics Late Submission of Coursework](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/student-services/taught-students/information-for-students/information-for-all-students/your-studies/late-coursework-extension-requests) Rule 3 with a __maximum 6 day extension__. Extensions, Extra Time Adjustment (ETA) for Extra Time and for Extra Time for Proof Reader/Interpreter are permitted, __but cannot be combined__.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is very important that you read and follow the instructions below to the letter: you will be deducted marks for not adhering to the advice below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good Scholarly Practice \n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember the University requirement as regards all assessed work for credit.  Details about this can be found at: [http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct](http://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/infweb/admin/policies/academic-misconduct)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, this coursework **must be your own work**. We want you to be able to discuss the class material with each other, but the coursework you submit must be your own work. You are free to form study groups and discuss the concepts related to, and the high-level approach to the coursework. **You may never share code or share write-ups**. It is also not permitted to discuss this coursework on Piazza. The only exception is that if you believe there is an error in the coursework, you may ask a private question to the instructors, and if we feel that the issue is justified, we will send out an announcement.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assessment information and criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "- This assignment accounts for 20% of the marks for this course.\n",
    "- It is marked based on the PDF export from a Jupyter notebook (see __General instructions__ below), which you are to submit via Gradescope (see __Assessment/Assignment Submission/Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn).\n",
    "- The assignment is marked out of 100 and the number of points is indicated by each question. \n",
    "- We will assess your work on the following criteria:\n",
    "  - functional code that (a) performs the computations asked for, as measured by verifying some of the numeric outputs from your processing and reading your code if there is doubt about what you have done and (b) is clear and makes good use of Pandas functions\n",
    "  - the quality of the visualisations, measured against the _Visualisation principles and guidance_ handout in the S1 Week 5 workshop (PDF available in S1 Week 4 folder in Learn)\n",
    "  - the quality of your textual comments - as measured by how accurate, complete and insightful they are.\n",
    " \n",
    "## General instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the instructions carefully, answering what is required and only that.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fill in your answers in the cells indicated. You may delete text like \"Your answer to Q1.2 goes here\". __Do not edit or delete any other cells.__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Keep your answers brief and concise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving visualisations, make sure to label them clearly and provide legends where necessary. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For answers involving numerical values, use correct units where appropriate and format floating point values to a reasonable number of decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished a question, use a Jupyter notebook server to export your PDF, by selecting __File->Download as->PDF via LaTeX (.pdf)__.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check this PDF document looks as you expect it to. If changes are needed, update the notebook and export again.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once you have finished all the questions, submit the final PDF using the submission instructions in the __Assessment->Assignment Submission->Coursework 1 - Data wrangling and visualisation__ folder in Learn. __Please allow enough time to upload your PDF before the deadline.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## How long should I spend on this coursework?\n",
    "\n",
    "We have designed the coursework to take around 8 hours for a student who has completed the lab sessions, attended the lectures and workshops and done the comprehension questions. There will be some spread around this value, but if you're up-to-date with the course, and you're taking much longer than 8 hours (say 12 hours), then you might want to consider how many marks you are gaining for each extra hour of work."

    "Designing a good visualisation can be time-consuming, but is important for clear communication. In this question we will ask you to identify and correct bad visualisation practices.

Each data frame contains two columns - a column called `Date` that denotes a date and a column called `Close` that contains the closing price of the cryptocurrency (in USD) recorded on the associated date. Since these cryptocurrencies were created at different times, the amount of data available for each is different. The data was adapted from a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory), which is under a CC0: Public Domain license.\n",

    "In Question 2 we will start exploring the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/) data for the years 2017 and 2018. In question 3 we'll do some data wrangling on the data, and then combine the data with another dataset in question 4. In question 5 we'll give you an opportunity to produce your own visualisation from the dataset.\n",

    "World Happiness Reports provide a measure of the happiness and well-being of inhabitants of countries (with a few exceptions) based on survey data. Each of a set of questions asks survey respondents to evaluate their life on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 is the worst possible life and 10 is the best. Additional data on six other measures (GDP per capita, life expectancy, generosity, social support, freedom, and corruption) are used to explain how much these factors increase happiness above Dystopia. Dystopia is a hypothetical country with values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors.  The [FAQ section of the World Happiness Report website](https://worldhappiness.report/faq/) has more information about the methodology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we ask you to read in the World Happiness Report data from 2017 and 2018, do some data wrangling, apply some fundamental data manipulation functions, create visualisations and analyse the trends that you find. The questions are organised so that the first few questions give more detailed instructions and the later questions are more open-ended. We also want you to consider whether there are any limitations of the data that should be considered. Finally, the datasets used in this notebook are not large enough to cause issues, but do consider computational complexity and efficiency of your code."
